# Rusted Warfare SteamDL Beta

## A portable mod downloader
I created this project only for downloading Rusted Warfare mods from **SteamWorkshop**.  
I do not plan to add more games that this downloader would support.  
**NOTES:** I have no plans to develop a mobile app version *(yet)*

## Changelogs:
### **v2.0** - Beta Update
- Added support for older systems
- Support for .NET 4.4 and above
- Improved visuals
- Improved UI
- Fixed: repeating download bug
- Fixed: null file downloaded

## Initial Setup:
This program needs SteamCMD to work.  

**1**. Download steamcmd.zip  
**2**. Create a "steamcmd" folder on your desktop  
**3**. Extract "steamcmd.exe"  
**4**. Place "steamcmd.exe" inside "steamcmd" folder.  
**5**. Download mod files...

## Feedback:
If you have issues or problems with the program, feel free to send your feedback!
